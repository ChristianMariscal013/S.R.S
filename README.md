&#x20;by its acronym with the meaning of:

A software requirements specification, It is basically a document that describes what the software will do and how it is expected to work. This includes the requirements you need to meet the needs of all interested parties.

### Characteristics of S.R.S:

* Unambiguos
* Complete
* Verifiable

### Benefits to write a S.R.S&#x20;

In addition to providing the foundation for successful product development by creating alignment between customers and suppliers and keeping everyone involved on the same page, an SRS offers a number of other benefits that make it well worth the effort required. to write it.

According to Rideau developer Kurosh Farsimadan, “The use of the SRS can eliminate and prevent errors in the design phase, as any conflicting requirements and features that need validation can be corrected at this point and stakeholders can be contacted for re-evaluation.”

It is always significantly less expensive to make changes early in the software development process than later, when countless hours and a great deal of energy and resources have already been expended. Having a well-written SRS helps streamline the development process by avoiding duplication of tasks and structuring problems so that they are easily solvable.

All other documentation, both technical and commercial, can be based on the SRS to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### Why is it important to define and document the software requirements specification?

There are many horror stories about software developers and customers clashing with project requirements, and one of the most common causes of such disputes is ambiguous language.

Vague terms like "urgent", "pending", "as soon as possible", etc., can mean something different to the customer and the development company or between the user and the development group.

Or, perhaps the parties involved have a different impression of the priority functionalities of the product. It's not the fault of either party, per se, they're just speaking different languages, in a sense.

The customer has an idea of the product, its features, and what the user interface might look like. But developers are usually thinking about "behind the scenes" of the project, how to write scalable and readable code, ensure security, make a solution work, minimize bugs, etc.
